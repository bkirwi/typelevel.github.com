We're partnering with [Skills Matter][skillsmatter]
and the [London Scala User Group][lsug]
to organise the second [Scala Exchange Hack Day][scalaxhack],
a free day of unconference and hack sessions,
co-located with [Scala Exchange][scalax].

The event is open to the whole community,
not just attendees of Scala Exchange,
and will run on 10th December 2016
(the day after Scala Exchange)
at [CodeNode][codenode],
Skills Matter's dedicated conference venue and tech hub
near Moorgate Station in central London.

The full list of sessions and topics
will be decided by the participants on the day.
There are some preliminary ideas on
the [ScalaxHack web site][scalaxhack].
We'll include hands-on hack sessions
to help people get involved with Scala open source,
including projects from inside and outside
the Typelevel family.

ScalaxHack is a free event.
Lunch will be sponsored by [Underscore][underscore].
